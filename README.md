My personal small overlay for Gentoo Linux.
Includes ebuilds for AppImageLauncher and a working driver for my TP-Link Archer T3U Wireless Adapter, which I couldn't find anywhere.


Use Layman to add it to your system:

sudo layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/q-g-j/qgj-overlay/master/qgj.xml -f -a qgj
